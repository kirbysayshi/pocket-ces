Pocket CES
==========

Pocket is basically a component entity system used as a test bed for my JSConf EU 2014 talk, [Developing Games Using Data not Trees][].

It has three concepts:

- Component Types (Definitions)
- Keys (ids)
- Systems

The [asteroids example][] is relatively complete. For more details, see the slides from the talk:

- [Keynote][]
- [SpeakerDeck][] (PDF)

You can run the asteroids example yourself by:

- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run demos`

And then visiting http://localhost:PORT/demos/asteroids/index.html (PORT is given in the console output).

And if you want to run the "finished" example as seen at the end of the JSConf EU 2014 talk:

- `git checkout jsconfeu-reworked`

And refresh!
