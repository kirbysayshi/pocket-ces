Pocket CES
==========

Pocket is basically a component entity system used as a test bed for my JSConf EU 2014 talk, [Developing Games Using Data not Trees][].

It has three concepts:

- Component Types (Definitions)
- Keys (ids)
- Systems

The [asteroids example][] is relatively complete. For more details, see the slides from the talk:

- [Keynote][]
- [SpeakerDeck][] (PDF)
